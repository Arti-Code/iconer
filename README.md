## CHANGELOG

### version 0.3

- **[UPGRADE]** dependencies
- **[FIXED]** some minor fixes

### version 0.2

Simple and useful application if you want to convert image file into *.ico file.

## How To Use

- just drag and drop image file on iconer.exe and it's done
- new *.ico file is created where the source file is located
- source image isn't deleted or even modified

## Cautions

- for now it works only with *.png files
- icon size (in pixels) is the same as source image.

PNG ---> ICO
